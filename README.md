# OldSkool Amp'd for Unreal Tournament 469

This is a modified version of UsAaR33's OldSkool Amp'd mod (version 2.30).

This version leverages UT 469-specific features to scale up the HUD and crosshair, while remaining network-compatible with UT 432-451 clients.

## Setup

To compile the source code, you should install the latest version of oldskool, and then clone this repository into a folder called "oldskool" in your Unreal Tournament root folder.

Next, you should copy the files in the oldskool/Build folder into your Unreal Tournament System folder.

## Compiling

You will need Unreal Tournament v469c Release Candidate 2 (or upwards) to compile the mod.

Compilation is pretty straightforward. Simply navigate into your Unreal Tournament System folder and run the batch script:

```
cd /path/to/UnrealTournament/System
oldskoolbuild.bat
```

## Credits

* OldSkool Amp'd was originally written by UsAaR33
